# interview-ready-java-dsa

Welcome to `interview-ready-java-dsa`, a comprehensive repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for coding interviews using Java. This repository is structured to provide weekly learning materials and challenges, starting with sorting techniques and two-pointer algorithms, and progressively covering more complex topics.

## About the Project

This project is designed to help both beginners and experienced developers enhance their skills in Java-based DSA, with a focus on interview preparation. Each week, we'll explore different DSA topics, starting with:

- **Week 1:** Sorting Techniques
- **Week 2:** Two-Pointers Algorithms
- **Week 3 and beyond:** Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository and explore the various topics covered each week. Each directory in the repository is dedicated to a specific DSA topic and contains relevant Java code examples and exercises.
