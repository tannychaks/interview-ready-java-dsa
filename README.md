# interview-ready-java-dsa

Welcome to `interview-ready-java-dsa`, a comprehensive repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for coding interviews using Java. This repository, curated by `tannychaks`, is structured to provide weekly learning materials and challenges, starting with sorting techniques and two-pointer algorithms, and progressively covering more complex topics.

## About the Project

This project is designed to help both beginners and experienced developers enhance their skills in Java-based DSA, with a focus on interview preparation. Each week, we'll explore different DSA topics, starting with:

- **Week 1:** Sorting Techniques
- **Week 2:** Two-Pointers & Fast-Slow pointers Algorithms
- **Week 3:** Sliding Window pattern
- **Week 4 and beyond:** Arrays, Binary Search, Linked List, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Trees, Graphs, Trie, etc.
