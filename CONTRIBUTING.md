## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## GitHub Flow for Code Changes

All code changes happen through pull requests. To contribute:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and commit them.
3. If you've added code, ensure it adheres to the coding style and add tests if applicable.
4. Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Coding Style

We follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). This style guide provides guidelines to keep our codebase consistent and easy to read. We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE, which has built-in support for this style guide.

To ensure your code conforms to the style guide, you can use the following tools:
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Set your code formatter to Google Style. Go to `File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java`, choose `Google Style` as the scheme.
- **Checkstyle**: Integrate Checkstyle in your build process or IDE to automatically check your code against the style guide.
